## Gene Network Co-expression
* **Rat LSD**: "Lysergic acid diethylamide induces increased signalling entropy in ratsâ€™ prefrontal cortex", Journal of neurochemistry, 2022. [[Paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34729786/)]

- **LSD** resembles schizophrenia, helps overcome substance abuse, changes personality by increasing openness.
- **Entropy** is a measure of number of possible states of a system. In cell biology, it intuitively quantifies cell plasticity and robustness to perturbations. Stem cells have high transcriptomal entropy that decreases across differentiation.
- **Gene co-expression network**: impact by LSD.
- **Data**: Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE179379).
- **Analysis**:

Psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, DOI) affect perception, behavior and mood through activation of serotonin $\text{5-HT}_\text{{2A}}$ receptors, especially on neocortical pyramidal cells.
