    "Organisms of all sizes use odor to find things. From a bacterium moving up an amino acid gradient to a wolf hunting down its prey, odor tracking can be essential for survival. Olfactory search behavior has been studied in many organisms, including bacteria (Berg, 2001), nematodes (Lockery, 2011), moths (Murlis et al., 1992; Vickers, 2000; Cardé and Willis, 2008), crustaceans (Reeder and Ache, 1980; Atema, 1996; Webster and Weissburg, 2001), fish (Scholz et al., 1976), and birds (Nevitt, 2000; Wallraff, 2004), revealing related but distinct strategies for localizing odor. A thorough survey of olfactory search in all these species is beyond the scope of this review. Here, we will focus on recent work by participants in a Mini-Symposium on “Algorithms for Olfactory Search Across Species,” describing new approaches to each of these problems in flies and rodents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "odor-gated anemotaxis: Another strategy used by many organisms is to turn upwind when an attractive odor is sensed (Flugge, 1934; Kennedy and Marsh, 1974; Murlis et al., 1992; Steck et al., 2012). This strategy, known as “odor-gated anemotaxis” requires animals to combine information about flow direction, derived from mechanosensation or vision, with information from the olfactory system (Kennedy, 1940; Wasserman et al., 2015; Bell and Wilson, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, olfactory search often entails active sampling of the environment\n",
    "(Fig. 2). For example, rats, moles, dogs,\n",
    "and humans all perform head-scanning\n",
    "during trail tracking (Porter et al., 2007;\n",
    "Khan et al., 2012; Catania, 2013). Drosophila larvae perform a similar headcasting behavior (Gomez-Marin et al.,\n",
    "2011) and may provide a tractable model\n",
    "for understanding the mechanisms and\n",
    "function of this active-sensing behavior\n",
    "in other organisms. Moreover, vertebrates control what, when, and where\n",
    "they smell through sniffing (Mainland\n",
    "and Sobel, 2006; Wachowiak, 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, large organisms search over\n",
    "much greater distances, which might\n",
    "require fundamentally different search strategies from those performed by bacteria. One strategy is to use spatial memory to\n",
    "create odor-informed maps of an environment (Jacobs, 2012).\n",
    "When tested with highly predictable sets of resource locations,\n",
    "rodents prefer to memorize source locations and then use this\n",
    "information to perform rapid, probabilistic searches across an\n",
    "environment, only using odor cues to confirm target acquisition when very near to a source (Bhattacharyya and Bhalla,\n",
    "2015; Gire et al., 2016). A second strategy, exemplified by\n",
    "flying insects, is to use multiple behavioral modules: dispersal,\n",
    "plume tracking, and visual search, to locate a smell, follow it\n",
    "upwind, and hone in on the source (Vickers and Baker, 1994;\n",
    "Carde´ and Willis, 2008; Lacey and Carde´, 2011; Lacey et al.,\n",

    "Most animals have multiple\n",

    "antennae (Yorozu et al., 2009) or their whiskers (Yan et al., 2016),\n",
    "and this information can indicate the likely direction of the odor\n",

    "through learning or through evolution, about the shape and\n",
    "movement of odor plumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For mammals, olfactory search can be subdivided into trail followi\n",
    "For plume\n",
    "following, the structure of search behavior is less clear. In previous\n",
    "studies, animals in familiar arenas adopted memory-guided strategies rather than relying on airborne odor cues (Bhattacharyya and\n",
    "Bhalla, 2015; Gire et al., 2016). Therefore, the behavioral structure of\n",

    "\n",
    "Strong evidence implicates memory, at multiple timescales, in\n",
    "olfactory search. At the shortest timescale, sensory memory enables the brain to track rapid changes in odor concentration, such\n",

    "crustaceans (Park et al., 2016), and mice (Parabucki et al., 2017).\n",
    "At the intermediate time scale, short-term memory can hold a\n",

    "The neural mechanisms of memory use during odor-guided\n",

    "in both sensory and short-term memory (Huston et al., 2015;\n",
    "Park et al., 2016; Gorur-Shandilya et al., 2017), with odor-evoked\n",
    "oscillations and reverberations within these circuits suggested as\n",
    "likely mechanisms for maintaining a history of odor encounters\n",
    "(Laurent and Davidowitz, 1994; Ache et al., 2016). These circuit\n",
    "mechanisms operate over long enough timescales to support navigation within fluctuating plumes at moderate distances (meters). The neural mechanisms used for longer searches across\n",

    "although they could involve a role for more integrative brain\n",
    "structures, such as the hippocampus in mammals, in olfactory\n",

    "experimentally in the hippocampus (Zhang and ManahanVaughan, 2015), as has the representation of odor sequences\n",
    "(MacDonald et al., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "How did the flies get from point A to point B? Although we\n",
    "cannot know the flies’ exact trajectories, all subsequent evidence\n",
    "suggests that this was a multistage process involving several behavior modules (Fig. 4). The first important conclusion is that\n",
    "hungry flies do not simply wait around until an odor plume\n",
    "comes to them; rather, they disperse, presumably in hopes of\n",
    "encountering an odor plume. Initially, the flies likely fanned out\n",
    " different directions from the release site. New evidence suggests that this dispersal phase is aided by celestial cues, including\n",
    "the position of the sun or moon and the pattern of polarized light\n",
    "in the sky. As with many other insects, flies could use such cues to\n",
    "maintain relatively straight trajectories, so that they cover long\n",
    "linear distances and increase the probability of encountering attractive odor plumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When flies do encounter an odor plume, they must quickly\n",

    "operation in field studies, our understanding of these search algorithms has been advanced by laboratory wind-tunnel experiments (Budick et al., 2006; van Breugel and Dickinson, 2014). In\n",
    "wind tunnels, flies exhibit behaviors that appear optimized for following the edges of turbulent odor structures. When flies encounter\n",
    "an odor filament, they quickly surge upwind. When they lose the\n",
    "odor, however, they exhibit a substantial delay before they execute a\n",
    "cross-wind cast (van Breugel and Dickinson, 2014). Simulations\n",
    "suggest that the cast delay enhances their ability to follow discontinuous odor plumes because they do not immediately exit the plume\n",
    "whenever they exit an odor packet. Their behavior basically creates a\n",
    "low pass spatial filter of the plume.\n",
    "\n",
    "pon tracking the odor plume to its source, the fly must land\n",

    "small visual objects after detecting attractive odors, which presumably serves to lead them toward potential sources of the odor\n",
    "plume (van Breugel et al., 2014; Saxena et al., 2018). This same\n",
    "behavior is exhibited by mosquitoes (van Breugel et al., 2015),\n",
    "suggesting that it is a quite ancient behavioral module among\n",
    "insects. Thus, the task of finding a new food resource over large\n",

    "One general navigation strategy preserved across species and environmental conditions involves the use of lateral back-and-forth changes in orientation of the olfactory sensors during active odor-sampling (Baker et al., 2018). Moths navigating odor plumes use this strategy to reacquire an odor plume, a behavior termed “zig-zagging” or “casting” depending on the magnitude and angle of displacement (Marsh et al., 1978; Kennedy, 1983; Kuenen and Carde, 1994; Carde and Willis, 2008). Flies (Budick and Dickinson, 2006) and cockroaches (Willis et al., 2008) use a similar casting strategy during plume navigation. Lateral back-and-forth behaviors are also often observed in animals following odor trails. Rats employ head oscillations that sweep back and forth across a trail as they track it (Khan et al., 2012), a strategy also used by humans (Porter et al., 2007) and ants (Hangartner, 1969; Draft et al., 2018) following trails. In this study, we use the term ‘casting’ to describe the amplitude of the movement of the olfactory sensors during navigation toward an odor source (Heitz, 2014; Zhao et al., 2017; Baker et al., 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful navigation of a complex odor environment likely involves different behavioral strategies under different conditions. Knowledge of the spatial structure of the environment, characteristics of specific odor cues, and general task context may all influence odor-guided behavior. Animals demonstrate strategy-switching between distinct behaviors as a consequence of both changes in odor stimulus properties and task context (Thesen et al., 1993; Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999; Wesson et al., 2008; Gire et al., 2016). Environmental familiarity and visual cues also influence decision-making strategy during odor source localization. Given visual cues to navigate, exploratory casting based on odor cues disappears on tasks with a small number of potential goal locations; instead, mice begin directly navigating to known odor source locations in straight-line trajectories (Bhattacharyya and Bhalla, 2015; Gire et al., 2016). This resembles the transition from exploration to exploitation behavior observed during successive search trials (Sutton and Barto, 1998; Hills et al., 2015). Thus, both behavioral context and the availability of orienting stimuli are important for strategy choice in odor source localization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use an open field odor-based spot-finding task to examine strategies of olfactory search for an odor source deposited on the surface under air flow conditions typical of an indoor setting. By randomizing odor source location, performing experiments in the dark, and using a discrete target odorant object, we prevent mice from switching to methods of systematic search based on memory, visual, or proprioceptive cues (Gire et al., 2016). We find that multiple dimensions of behavior are varied as mice approach the odor source, including velocity and casting, suggesting that these behaviors are associated with odor localization. We then created agent-based models of olfactory search and used simulations to interrogate the roles of binaral-sniffing, variable velocity, and variable casting on effective odor localization. Both behavioral and simulation data suggest that multiple behavioral strategies are important for successful odor navigation to a deposited odor source under typical indoor air flow conditions in mice."
