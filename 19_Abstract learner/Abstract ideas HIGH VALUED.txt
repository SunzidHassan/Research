Case study of ML in Bangladesh corporate sector:

what is the general benefit:
1. We want to model customer segments from available little data (purchase pattern etc.), which'll help us create customised branding effort
2. We want to model purchase pattern of BD customers segments with ML, so that we can use targeted recommendation
3. Some sort of application of transfer learning
4. Overall market classification and gap

2.1 Un/Supervised: labeled input for supervised - akin to recommender system - attributes of user id (at each week, what the user purchases, given the factors - discount, ?) vs purchase history - predict further purchase pattern or recommendation, cross match with actual result. What can be usefullness in terms of profitability.

2.2 RL: state (similar to factors selected under recommender system), action (buy or don't buy), reward (match if 1, 0 if not). However, there are many different customers, will there be many dfiferent agents?
- predict further purchase pattern or recommendation, cross match with actual result. What can be usefullness in terms of profitability.

Homework:
a map of consumer classes
linking behavioral cycle of consumers with the map, the differences, and different strategies to engage them
what are the existing data avaialble - what can be cleaned and used (discount available for each product at different weeks can be cleaned)

available data:
customer purchase history - done
offered discount compared to MRP - need content data of tracker and system product match - only keep campaign tracker data of those products
branding: target group (available info about customers), selected products, methods, reach (width, repetation) - need to check data availability
seller payment data - an organized incomplete (seller payment trackers) and disorganized more complete source (accounting trackers) - it'd be great if the name of account data matches system group name
